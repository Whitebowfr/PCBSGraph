# PCBSGraph
 
How to use this :
- The first select box is for changing the order of sorting (ascending/descending)
- The second one is for switching between the CPU and GPU chart
- The third one is to choose from which factor the chart will be sorted
- The first input field is to search something in the chart (it includes everything so even score, frequency etc), it's not case-sensitive but you need to write exaclty the right thing
- The refresh button is to refresh the chart, useful when you disabled the auto-refresh obviously
- The second input field is to change the frequency of a CPU (you need to have only one CPU on the graph so use the search function), you enter a frequency and hit Store.
To reset the frequencies (you can store as much as you want), just reload the page (Ctrl + R)
- The third input field is to change the RAM speed : enter a number and it will simulate the CPUs running at this speed.
- The first checkbox is to enable/disable logarithmic scaling of the graph (switch between a linear and a logarithmic scale)
- The second checkbox is to disable the auto-updating of the chart (so when you change things it doesnt update the chart. The only things that will update the chart no matter what are the sort order, the CPU/GPU selector, the type of sorting and the logarithmic scaling.
- The last checkbox is to enable/disable HEM parts.

And you can also click on the legend label to show different datasets. (for example, clicking on Frequency will show/hide the frequency bar)
